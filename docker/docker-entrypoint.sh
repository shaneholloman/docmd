# Handles two cases:
#
#   1. No volume / empty /docs  → seeds the demo template so `docmd dev`
#      works out of the box with no arguments.
#
#   2. Host-mounted volume      → detects the uid:gid that owns /docs and
#      re-execs as that identity (via su-exec), so file writes from any
#      subcommand — including `docmd init` — land with the correct host
#      ownership without needing `-u $(id -u):$(id -g)` from the caller.
#
# This mirrors the pattern used by official images (postgres, redis, etc.).
