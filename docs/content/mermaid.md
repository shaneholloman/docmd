# Mermaid Diagrams

Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically. docmd has built-in support for Mermaid diagrams with automatic light/dark theme switching.

::: callout tip
All Mermaid diagrams automatically adapt to your site's light/dark theme!
:::

## Flowchart

Flowcharts are used to represent workflows or processes. They show the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
    B -->|No| D[Debug]
    D --> E[Fix the issue]
    E --> B
    C --> F[Deploy]
    F --> G[End]
```

## Sequence Diagram

Sequence diagrams show how processes operate with one another and in what order. They capture the interaction between objects in the context of a collaboration.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    participant Database
    
    User->>Browser: Enter URL
    Browser->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Database: Query Data
    Database-->>Server: Return Results
    Server-->>Browser: HTTP Response
    Browser-->>User: Display Page
```

## Class Diagram

Class diagrams are the main building block of object-oriented modeling. They show the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations, and relationships.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        +String name
        +int age
        +makeSound()
    }
    class Dog {
        +String breed
        +bark()
    }
    class Cat {
        +String color
        +meow()
    }
    
    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```

## Entity Relationship Diagram

Entity Relationship Diagrams are used to model the logical structure of databases. They show entities (tables) and the relationships between them.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string email
        string phone
    }
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        date orderDate
        string status
    }
    PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE-ITEM : "ordered in"
    PRODUCT {
        string name
        decimal price
        string category
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        int quantity
        decimal total
    }
```

## State Diagram

State diagrams describe the states of an object and the transitions between those states. They're useful for modeling the lifecycle of an object.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Processing : Start
    Processing --> Success : Complete
    Processing --> Error : Fail
    Success --> [*]
    Error --> Retry : Retry
    Retry --> Processing
    Error --> [*] : Give Up
```

## User Journey

User journey diagrams visualize the journey users take when using your product or service. They help identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.

```mermaid
journey
    title My working day
    section Go to work
      Make tea: 5: Me
      Go upstairs: 3: Me
      Do work: 1: Me, Cat
    section Go home
      Go downstairs: 5: Me
      Sit down: 5: Me
```

## Gantt Chart

Gantt charts illustrate a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of elements and summary elements of a project.

```mermaid
gantt
    title Project Development Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Planning
    Requirements gathering :a1, 2024-01-01, 30d
    Design phase          :a2, after a1, 20d
    section Development
    Frontend development  :a3, 2024-02-01, 40d
    Backend development   :a4, 2024-02-01, 45d
    Integration          :a5, after a3 a4, 15d
    section Testing
    QA Testing           :a6, after a5, 20d
    Bug fixes            :a7, after a6, 10d
    section Deployment
    Production deploy    :a8, after a7, 5d
```

## Pie Chart

Pie charts are circular statistical graphics divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions.

```mermaid
pie title Browser Usage Statistics
    "Chrome" : 64.5
    "Safari" : 18.2
    "Firefox" : 8.5
    "Edge" : 4.8
    "Other" : 4.0
```

## Quadrant Chart

Quadrant charts are useful for prioritization and categorizing items based on two dimensions.

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Reach and engagement of campaigns
    x-axis Low Reach --> High Reach
    y-axis Low Engagement --> High Engagement
    quadrant-1 We should expand
    quadrant-2 Need to promote
    quadrant-3 Re-evaluate
    quadrant-4 May be improved
    Campaign A: [0.3, 0.6]
    Campaign B: [0.45, 0.23]
    Campaign C: [0.57, 0.69]
    Campaign D: [0.78, 0.34]
    Campaign E: [0.40, 0.34]
    Campaign F: [0.35, 0.78]
```

## Git Graph

Git graphs visualize Git branching and merging operations, making it easier to understand version control workflows.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge develop
    commit
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature
    commit
```

## Mindmap

Mindmaps are diagrams used to visually organize information hierarchically, showing relationships among pieces of the whole.

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((docmd))
    Features
      Markdown Support
      Custom Containers
      Themes
        Light Mode
        Dark Mode
      Plugins
    Documentation
      Getting Started
      Configuration
      Deployment
    Community
      GitHub
      Contributors
      Issues
```

## Timeline

Timeline diagrams show events in chronological order along a line, making it easy to understand the sequence and duration of events.

```mermaid
timeline
    title History of Web Development
    2000 : Web 1.0
         : Static HTML pages
    2005 : Web 2.0
         : Dynamic content
         : AJAX revolution
    2010 : Mobile First
         : Responsive design
    2015 : Modern Frameworks
         : React
         : Vue
         : Angular
    2020 : JAMstack Era
         : Static Site Generators
         : Serverless
```

## XY Chart

XY charts display data as a series of points on a coordinate plane, useful for showing correlations and trends.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Sales Revenue by Quarter"
    x-axis [Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4]
    y-axis "Revenue (in $1000)" 0 --> 100
    bar [50, 60, 70, 85]
    line [45, 55, 75, 80]
```

## Kanban Board

Kanban boards visualize work at various stages of a process, helping teams manage workflow and identify bottlenecks.

```mermaid
---
config:
  kanban:
    ticketBaseUrl: 'https://mermaidchart.atlassian.net/browse/#TICKET#'
---
kanban
  Todo

    docs[Create Blog about the new diagram]

    id6[Create renderer so that it works in all cases. We also add some extra text here for testing purposes. And some more just for the extra flare.]
  id9[Ready for deploy]

    id3[Update DB function]@{ ticket: MC-2037, assigned: knsv, priority: 'High' }

  id12[Can't reproduce]
    id3[Weird flickering in Firefox]

```

## Architecture Diagram

Architecture diagrams show the high-level structure of software systems, including components and their relationships.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group api(cloud)[API Layer]
    
    service db(database)[Database] in api
    service cache(disk)[Cache] in api
    service queue(disk)[Queue] in api
    
    service server(server)[API Server] in api
    
    server:L -- R:db
    server:B -- T:cache
    server:T -- B:queue
```

## C4 Diagram

C4 diagrams provide different levels of abstraction for software architecture visualization, from system context down to code.

```mermaid
C4Context
    title System Context diagram for Internet Banking System
    
    Person(customerA, "Personal Banking Customer", "A customer of the bank")
    Person(customerB, "Business Banking Customer", "A business customer")
    
    System(SystemAA, "Internet Banking System", "Allows customers to view information about their accounts")
    
    System_Ext(SystemE, "Mainframe Banking System", "Stores all core banking information")
    System_Ext(SystemC, "E-mail system", "The internal Microsoft Exchange system")
    
    Rel(customerA, SystemAA, "Uses")
    Rel(customerB, SystemAA, "Uses")
    
    Rel(SystemAA, SystemE, "Gets account information from")
    Rel(SystemAA, SystemC, "Sends e-mails", "SMTP")
```

## Best Practices

When using Mermaid diagrams in your documentation:

1. **Keep it Simple**: Start with simple diagrams and add complexity only when needed
2. **Use Clear Labels**: Make sure all nodes and connections are clearly labeled
3. **Consider Your Audience**: Adjust the level of detail based on who will read the documentation
4. **Test Both Themes**: Always check how your diagrams look in both light and dark modes
5. **Add Context**: Use callouts or text around diagrams to explain what they represent
