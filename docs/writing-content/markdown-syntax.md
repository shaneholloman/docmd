# Markdown Syntax

`docmd` uses `markdown-it` under the hood, which is a highly extensible and standards-compliant Markdown parser. It supports CommonMark syntax by default, along with some useful extensions like GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) tables and strikethrough.

## Common Elements

You can use all standard Markdown elements:

*   **Headings:**
    ```markdown
    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    ...
    ###### Heading 6
    ```
*   **Paragraphs:** Just type text. Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
*   **Emphasis:**
    ```markdown
    *This text will be italic.*
    _This will also be italic._

    **This text will be bold.**
    __This will also be bold.__

    ***This text will be bold and italic.***
    ```
*   **Lists:**
    *   **Unordered:**
        ```markdown
        * Item 1
        * Item 2
          * Nested Item 2a
          * Nested Item 2b
        + Item 3 (using +)
        - Item 4 (using -)
        ```
    *   **Ordered:**
        ```markdown
        1. First item
        2. Second item
        3. Third item
           1. Nested ordered item
        ```
*   **Links:**
    ```markdown
    [Link Text](https://www.example.com)
    [Link with Title](https://www.example.com "Link Title")
    [Relative Link to another page](../section/other-page.md)
    ```
    *Note: For internal links to other documentation pages, use relative paths to the `.md` files. `docmd` will convert these to the correct HTML paths during the build.*

*   **Images:**
    ```markdown
    ![Alt text for image](/path/to/your/image.jpg "Optional Image Title")
    ```
    *Place images in your `docs/` directory (e.g., `docs/images/`) or a similar assets folder that gets copied to your `site/` output.*

*   **Blockquotes:**
    ```markdown
    > This is a blockquote.
    > It can span multiple lines.
    ```
*   **Horizontal Rules:**
    ```markdown
    ---
    ***
    ___
    ```
*   **Inline Code:**
    ```markdown
    Use `backticks` for inline code like `variableName`.
    ```

## Code Blocks & Syntax Highlighting

`docmd` uses `highlight.js` for automatic syntax highlighting of fenced code blocks. Specify the language after the opening triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
greet('docmd user');
```

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello from Python!")

hello()
```

```html
<div>
  <p>This is some HTML.</p>
</div>
```

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
```

```bash
npm install -g docmd
docmd init my-docs
```

If you don't specify a language, `highlight.js` will attempt to auto-detect it, or it will be rendered as plain preformatted text.

## Tables (GFM Style)

You can create tables using GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax:

```bash
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| :------- | :------: | -------: |
| Align L  | Center   | Align R  |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
```
Renders as:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| :------- | :------: | -------: |
| Align L  | Center   | Align R  |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## Strikethrough (GFM Style)

Wrap text with two tildes (`~~`) for strikethrough:
```bash
This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.
```
Renders as: This is ~~strikethrough~~ text.

## HTML

Because `markdown-it` is configured with `html: true`, you can embed raw HTML directly in your Markdown files. However, use this sparingly, as it can make your content less portable and harder to maintain.

```html
<div style="color: blue;">
  This is a blue div rendered directly from HTML.
</div>
```

For most formatting needs, standard Markdown and `docmd`'s [Custom Containers](./custom-containers.md) should suffice.

# Advanced Markdown Capabilities

Beyond the basic syntax, `docmd` supports a variety of advanced Markdown features to help you create richer documentation.

## Example Callout

::: callout info
This is a real callout example to test container rendering. Callouts are great for highlighting important information.
:::

::: callout warning
**Warning!** Be careful when using advanced features, ensure they are properly documented.
:::

## GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)

docmd supports GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions including:

- **Task Lists** - Create interactive checklists:
  ```markdown
  - [x] Completed task
  - [ ] Incomplete task
  - [ ] Another item
  ```
  
  Renders as:
  - [x] Completed task
  - [ ] Incomplete task
  - [ ] Another item

- **Autolinked References** - URL and email addresses are automatically linked:
  ```markdown
  Visit https://docmd.mgks.dev for more information.
  Contact support@example.com for help.
  ```

- **Emoji** - Use emoji shortcodes:
  ```markdown
  I :heart: documentation! :rocket: :smile:
  ```
  
  Renders emoji symbols like: I ❤️ documentation! 🚀 😄

## Footnotes

You can add footnotes to your content for references or additional information[^1].

```markdown
Here's a statement that needs citation[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.
```

Multiple footnotes can be used throughout your document[^2], and the definitions can be collected at the bottom.

[^1]: This is the first footnote reference.
[^2]: This is the second footnote with more information.

## Definition Lists

Some Markdown parsers support definition lists:

```markdown
Term
: Definition for the term.
: Another definition for the same term.

Another Term
: Definition of another term.
```

Term
: Definition for the term.
: Another definition for the same term.

Another Term
: Definition of another term.

## Abbreviations

You can define abbreviations in your Markdown (depending on plugin support):

```markdown
*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium

HTML is defined by the W3C standards.
```

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium

HTML is defined by the W3C standards.

## Math Expressions

If enabled with the appropriate plugins, you can include mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax:

```markdown
Inline math: $E=mc^2$

Block math:
$$
\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x
$$
```

## Container Extensions

Beyond standard Markdown, docmd provides custom containers for enhanced formatting. 
These are detailed in the [Custom Containers](./custom-containers.md) guide, and include:

::: callout info
Use containers for callouts, cards, and steps to structure your documentation.
:::

## Conclusion

Markdown provides a powerful yet simple way to write and format documentation. With docmd's extensions and customizations, you can create rich, beautiful documentation that's easy to maintain.
