# Deploying Your docmd Site

Once you've built your documentation site using `docmd build`, the entire static site is generated into the `site/` directory (or your configured `outputDir`). This `site/` directory contains all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets needed, making it deployable to any static hosting service.

## Building for Production

Before deployment, ensure you build your site in production mode:

```bash
docmd build
```

This generates optimized HTML, CSS, and assets ready for production use. In production, `docmd` may:
- Minify CSS and JavaScript assets (future feature)
- Optimize HTML output

## Deployment Options

Since `docmd` generates a standard static site, you can use any static hosting service. Here are some popular options:

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a popular and free way to host static sites directly from your GitHub repository. `docmd` sites are perfectly suited for this.

#### Option 1: Deploy from a Branch

1. **Push your source files and built site to GitHub.**
2. **Go to your repository settings.**
3. **Navigate to the "Pages" section.**
4. **Under "Source", select the branch and directory where your built site is located.**

The simplest approach is to choose one of:

*   **Built site in the `docs/` folder on the main branch:**
    *   Configure `docmd`'s `outputDir` to be `docs` in your `docmd.config.js` (e.g., `outputDir: 'docs'`).
    *   Select "Deploy from a branch" → "main" → "/docs"

If you set `outputDir: 'docs'`, your `docmd.config.js` for `docmd` itself (when building its own docs) would look like:

```javascript
// docmd.config.js for docmd's own docs, deploying from /docs on main
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: 'docmd Docs',
  srcDir: 'documentation', // Assuming actual source MD files are NOT in the output 'docs'
  outputDir: 'docs',
  // ... other config ...
};
```

#### Option 2: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

The most robust and automated way to deploy to GitHub Pages is using a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow will run `docmd build` and then deploy the resulting `site/` directory.

Create a file at `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy docmd docs to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]  # Your default branch
  workflow_dispatch:   # Allows manual workflow trigger from Actions tab

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install docmd (globally or from devDependencies)
        run: npm install -g @mgks/docmd

      - name: Build site with docmd
        run: docmd build # Assumes docmd.config.js is in the root and correctly points to srcDir/outputDir

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./site # This should be your outputDir path

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Then:
1.  **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings**, selecting "GitHub Actions" as the source.
2.  **Push the workflow file to your repository**.
3.  On the next push to `main` (or if you manually trigger the workflow), the Action will run, build your `docmd` site, and deploy it. The URL will be something like `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY/`.

### Other Hosting Options

* **Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages** - Upload or connect your Git repository and set the build command to your npm script that runs `docmd build`.
* **Any Web Server** - Simply upload the contents of the `site/` directory to any web server that can serve static files.

By following these guidelines, you can easily get your `docmd`-powered documentation online and accessible to your users.
