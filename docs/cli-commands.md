# CLI Commands

`docmd` provides a set of commands to help you initialize, build, and preview your documentation site.

## `docmd init`

Initializes a new `docmd` project in the current directory.

**Usage:**
```bash
docmd init
```

**Description:**
This command creates the basic file and directory structure required for a `docmd` project:
*   `docs/`: A directory to store your Markdown source files.
    *   `docs/index.md`: A sample Markdown file.
*   `config.js`: The main configuration file for your site, pre-filled with default settings.

If a `docs/` directory or `config.js` file already exists, `docmd init` will typically warn you and avoid overwriting them to prevent accidental data loss.

**Options:**
This command currently does not take any options.

## `docmd build`

Builds your static documentation site.

**Usage:**
```bash
docmd build [options]
```

**Description:**
The `build` command reads your Markdown files from the source directory (specified by `srcDir` in `config.js`, defaults to `docs/`), processes them along with your `config.js`, and generates a complete static website in the output directory (specified by `outputDir` in `config.js`, defaults to `site/`).

The output `site/` directory contains all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets needed to deploy your documentation.

By default, the build process will update all assets to ensure you have the latest versions from the docmd package. This ensures your site benefits from the latest improvements and fixes.

**Options:**

*   `-c, --config <path>`
    *   **Default:** `config.js`
    *   **Description:** Specifies the path to the configuration file. Useful if your config file is not named `config.js` or is not in the project root.
    *   **Example:** `docmd build --config my.docmd.config.js`

*   `-p, --preserve`
    *   **Default:** `false`
    *   **Description:** Preserves existing asset files instead of updating them. Use this flag if you've customized any of the default assets and want to keep your modifications.
    *   **Example:** `docmd build --preserve`

## `docmd dev`

Starts a local development server with live reloading.

**Usage:**
```bash
docmd dev [options]
```

**Description:**
The `dev` command is essential for writing and previewing your documentation. It:
1.  Performs an initial build of your site.
2.  Starts a local web server (usually on `http://localhost:3000`).
3.  Watches your source files (`docs/` directory, `config.js`, and internal `docmd` theme assets) for changes.
4.  When a change is detected, it automatically rebuilds the necessary parts of your site and triggers a live reload in your browser.

This provides a fast feedback loop, allowing you to see your changes almost instantly.

**Options:**

*   `-c, --config <path>`
    *   **Default:** `config.js`
    *   **Description:** Specifies the path to the configuration file.
    *   **Example:** `docmd dev --config my.docmd.config.js`

*   `-p, --preserve`
    *   **Default:** `false`
    *   **Description:** Preserves existing asset files instead of updating them. Use this flag if you've customized any of the default assets and want to keep your modifications.
    *   **Example:** `docmd dev --preserve`

*   `-p, --port <port_number>` (Future Option)
    *   **Description:** While not yet implemented, a future version might allow specifying a custom port for the development server. Currently, it defaults to port 3000 or the next available port if 3000 is in use.

## Global Options (Apply to all commands)

*   `--version`
    *   **Usage:** `docmd --version`
    *   **Description:** Displays the installed version of `docmd`.
*   `--help`
    *   **Usage:** `docmd --help` or `docmd <command> --help` (e.g., `docmd build --help`)
    *   **Description:** Displays help information for `docmd` or a specific command, including available options.
